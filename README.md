# Algorithms
freeCodeCamp offer a series of programming exercises in Javascript, for preparing coding interview, in this page. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/

This repository is my solutions to the course "Algorithms" from the mentioned URL.

Algorithms.

These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic and programming skills.
These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. We'll give you clear and concise explanations of how these different algorithms work so you can implement a solution for each one.


In this Github repo I am uploading for each of the exercises: one PDF file with the description of the exercise + one js file with my solution to the exercise.
